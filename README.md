# Interpreter Project — Toy Programming Language

This project implements a full interpreter for a small custom programming language.
It reads source code, analyzes it, and executes program instructions — similar in structure to real interpreters and compilers, but intentionally compact and understandable.

## What it includes

Lexer / tokenizer

Parser (building an internal representation / AST)

Semantic checks

Runtime evaluator executing user programs

Modular architecture designed for extensibility

## Goals

Explore how interpreters and compilers work at a low level

Build a structured and maintainable codebase for a non-trivial system

Gain hands-on experience with language design and execution models

Demonstrate clean architecture practices for systems projects

## Scale

The project consists of a few thousand lines of code — enough to resemble “real-world” language tooling, while remaining small enough to fully understand and evolve.
